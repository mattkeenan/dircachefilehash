# Workflow Steps

Detailed guidance for workflow steps in the CWF system. Each step includes purpose, focus/avoid guidelines, key questions, typical structure, and transition triggers.

## Version Differences

**v2.0 Format** (8 phases): a-task-plan, b-requirements-plan, c-design-plan, d-implementation-plan, f-testing-plan, h-rollout, i-maintenance, j-retrospective

**v2.1 Format** (10 phases): v2.0 phases + e-testing-plan (moved from f), f-implementation-exec, g-testing-exec (note: e and f swapped from v2.0 order)
- Separates planning from execution for implementation and testing
- Enables clear distinction between "what we'll do" (planning) and "what we did" (execution)
- Planning phases focus on approach, execution phases focus on actual results

This document covers all phases for both v2.0 and v2.1 formats.

## Status Values

When updating the **Status** field in workflow files, use ONLY valid status values from `cwf-project.json`.

### Valid Status Values

The following status values are defined in the project configuration:

- **Backlog** (0%): Task not started, queued for future work
- **Blocked** (15%): Task started but cannot proceed until blocker resolved
- **To-Do** (0%): Task ready to begin, prioritized
- **In Progress** (25%): Work actively underway
- **Testing** (75%): Testing in progress, validation ongoing
- **Finished** (100%): Fully complete, all criteria met
- **Cancelled** (0%): Task abandoned or superseded; terminal status, no further work expected. Document cancellation reason separately. Works with both v2.0 and v2.1 formats.
- **Skipped** (N/A): Phase not applicable to this specific task (may also apply to entire task type) (v2.1 only)

**Using "Skipped" Status** (v2.1 only):

Mark any workflow step as "Skipped" when it's not applicable. This is typically a **per-task decision** (this specific task doesn't need this phase) but may also be a **task-type pattern** (e.g., most bugfixes skip rollout).

Examples:
- **Maintenance** for a specific bugfix (this fix doesn't need ongoing monitoring)
- **Rollout** for internal tools (this tool has no external deployment)
- **Requirements** for a specific hotfix (requirements already clear for this fix)
- **Design** for a trivial change (this change needs no architecture)

"Skipped" phases are excluded from progress calculation. Example: 9 completed + 1 skipped = 9/9 = 100% (not 9/10 = 90%).

**Distinction**: "Skipped" (not applicable to this task) ≠ "Backlog" (not started yet) ≠ "Finished" (completed).

**IMPORTANT**: Do not use arbitrary status values. Always select from this list. If you encounter an unknown status value, the system will warn you and default to 0% completion.

## Planning

**Purpose**: Establish clear objectives, success criteria, and high-level approach before diving into details.

**Simplicity Principles**:

Keeping the system simple is a core goal. Sometimes this means "don't add new features/code for the sake of adding" and can also sometimes mean "we don't need that (anymore), remove it".

- **"The best part is no part"**: The simplest, most reliable solution often involves removing unnecessary code or not adding it in the first place
- **"Reduce, reuse, recycle"**: Minimise new code, leverage existing solutions, extract common patterns only when proven necessary

When planning, explicitly consider:
- What can be removed or simplified?
- What existing code/files/artifacts does this make obsolete?
- What's the minimal solution that satisfies requirements?

**Focus on**:
- Single-sentence objective that captures the "why"
- 3-5 measurable success criteria that define "done"
- Major milestones showing progression
- Top 3-5 risks with mitigation strategies
- Dependencies (external, team, technical)
- Constraints (technical, resource, timeline)
- Decomposition signals check

**Avoid**:
- Implementation details or code specifics
- Detailed design decisions
- Specific technology choices (save for design phase)
- Test case details
- Deployment procedures

**Key Questions**:
- What problem are we solving and why does it matter?
- How will we know when we're successful?
- What are the major milestones from start to finish?
- What could go wrong and how do we mitigate it?
- What do we depend on and what depends on this?
- What constraints limit our approach?
- Is this task too large (check decomposition signals)?

**Structure**: Defined in workflow file template (`.cwf/templates/pool/`).

**Checkpoint Commit**: See `.cwf/docs/skills/checkpoint-commit.md`. Stage: `a-task-plan.md`

**Transition Triggers**:
- **Primary → Requirements**: Planning complete, objectives clear
- **Alternative → Decomposition**: 2+ decomposition signals triggered, create subtasks
- **Alternative → Clarification**: Objectives unclear, request user input

---

## Requirements

**Purpose**: Define what the system must do (functional) and how well it must do it (non-functional) with clear acceptance criteria.

**Focus on**:
- Functional requirements (FR1-FRn) with specific acceptance criteria
- Non-functional requirements across 5 dimensions:
  - NFR1: Performance (response time, throughput, resource usage)
  - NFR2: Usability (learning curve, error recovery, consistency)
  - NFR3: Maintainability (code clarity, modularity, testability)
  - NFR4: Security (authentication, authorization, data protection)
  - NFR5: Reliability (availability, error handling, data integrity)
- User stories capturing user perspective
- Acceptance criteria as testable checkpoints
- Constraints (technical, integration, resource)

**Avoid**:
- Implementation approaches or "how" details
- Code structure or architecture decisions
- Deployment strategies
- Specific technology choices
- Design patterns

**Key Questions**:
- What must the system do? (Functional requirements)
- How well must it perform? (Performance NFRs)
- How usable must it be? (Usability NFRs)
- How maintainable must it be? (Maintainability NFRs)
- What security requirements exist? (Security NFRs)
- How reliable must it be? (Reliability NFRs)
- How do we verify each requirement? (Acceptance criteria)
- What are the hard constraints?
