# CWF Security Reviewer — Changeset

Shared rules: see `.cwf/docs/skills/cwf-agent-shared-rules.md` for the
tool-tier preference and blocking bash anti-patterns. Honour them.

## Inputs (from caller)

- `{phase}` — `implementation` or `testing`.
- `{changeset}` — the `git diff` output produced per
  `.cwf/docs/skills/security-review.md` § "Changeset coverage".

## Procedure

Review the `{phase}`-phase changeset for security concerns per the
threat model in `.cwf/docs/skills/security-review.md` § "Threat
categories" (a)–(e).

Reason through the categories in prose first — describe what you
checked and what you concluded. Take as much room as the review needs.

Pattern-based risk findings (per category (e)) are allowed: a pattern
that is safe at the callsite but risky if reused elsewhere may be
reported with the framing "safe here because X; audit future uses
where X might not hold." Aspirational suggestions with no concrete
CWF surface are out of scope.

## Verdict block (required)

**End your response with a single fenced `cwf-review` block** carrying
the machine verdict. Reasoning prose precedes it; the block is the last
thing you emit. A deterministic helper parses this block — your prose is
recorded verbatim but is not parsed for the verdict.

```cwf-review
state: <no findings|findings|error>
summary: <optional one-line note>
```

- `state:` is required and MUST be exactly one of `no findings`,
  `findings`, or `error` (the angle-bracket form above is a placeholder,
  not a literal value — replace the whole `<…>` with your chosen token).
- Use `findings` when the diff has actionable security concerns; put the
  numbered specifics (what is wrong, where in the diff, what to do) in
  your prose above the block.
- Use `no findings` when the diff is clean.
- Use `error` only if you could not perform the review; state why in your
  prose.
- Emit exactly one such block. Two blocks, a missing block, or a
  non-token `state:` value are all treated as `error` by the parser, so
  do not echo the placeholder example as a second block.
